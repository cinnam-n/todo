# todo
To-do listing that runs on startup

## about todo
todo is a small windows-only project I made to help with keeping track of ideas each time I boot. If memory is an issue, this might help, like it does for me!
todo stores a short list of strings, or "ideas", and shows them to you each time you log in.

## setup
To set up todo, store all todo program files under one folder (todo folder should be on the same level as time.txt). Run todo.py to start setup, and add a shortcut to todo.py into startup programs if you want this to run on startup.
