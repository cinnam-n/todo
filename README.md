# todo
To-do listing that runs on startup

## about todo
todo is a small windows-only project I made to help with keeping track of ideas each time I boot. If memory is an issue, this might help, like it does for me!
todo stores a short list of strings, or "ideas", and shows them to you each time you log in.

## setup
There isn't a setup for todo, so if you want to use this, you'll have to edit code manually to fit with where you're storing todo. All that has to change is the file paths to the todo directory, and todo should work fine. Improvements on this will come soon as I work on this more.
